White-box Test (aka clear-box or transparent test)
> Relies on the test creator's knowledge of the software being tested to construct the test cases

Black-box Test
> Written with an awareness of what the program is supposed to do - its requirements or specifications - but not how it does it

Integration Test
> Verifies that the interactions between the different pieces of code in integrated environments are working the way we expect them to

Regression Test
> Written as part of a debugging and troubleshooting process to verify that an issue/error has been fixed once identified
> i.e. If there is a bug, first write a test that fails by triggering the buggy behavior, then fix the bug so that a test passes
> Ensures that the same mistake doesn't happen twice

Smoke Test/Build Verification Test
> Serves as a sanity check to find major bugs in a program; answers basic questions like: Does the program run? 
> Usually ran before more refined testing takes place

Load Test
> Verifies that the system behaves well when it's under significant load
