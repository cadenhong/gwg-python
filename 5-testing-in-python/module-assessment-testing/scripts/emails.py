"""
populate_dictionary(filename) reads the user_emails.csv file and populates a dictionary with name/value pairs.
find_emails(argv) searches the dictionary created in the previous function for the user name passed to the function as a parameter.
It then returns the associated email address.

This script accepts employee's first name and last name as command-line arguments and outputs their email address.

The script accepts arguments through the command line. These arguments are stored in a list named sys.argv.
The first element of this list, i.e. argv[0], is always the name of the file being executed.
So the parameters, i.e., first name and last name, are then stored in argv[1] and argv[2] respectively.
