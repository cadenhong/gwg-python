INTRODUCTION
Change the username of your coworker Jane Doe from "jane" to "jdoe" in compliance with company's naming policy.
The username change has already been done.
However, some files that were named with Jane's previous username "jane" haven't been updated yet.
Write a bash script and a Python script that will take care of the necessary rename operations.

WHAT YOU'LL DO
- Practice using the cat, grep, and cut commands for file operations
- Use > and >> commands to redirect I/O stream
- Replace a substring using Python
- Run bash commands in Python
