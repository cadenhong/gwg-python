INTRODUCTION
Imagine one of your colleagues is struggling with a program that keeps throwing an error. Unfortunately, the program's source code is too complicated to easily find the error there. The good news is that the program outputs a log file you can read! Let's write a script to search the log file for the exact error, then output that error into a separate file so you can work out what's wrong.

WHAT YOU'LL DO
  - Write a script to search the log file using regex to find for the exact error.
  - Report the error into a separate file so you know what's wrong for further analysis.

NOTE
../data/fishy.log is written in the following format: Month Day hour:minute:second mycomputername "process_name"["random 5 digit number"] "ERROR/INFO/WARN" "Error description"

The sys module provides information about the Python interpreter's constants, functions, and methods.
The os module provides a portable way of using operating system dependent functionality with Python.
The re module is for Regular Expression (RegEx), using a sequence of characters that defines a search pattern.
